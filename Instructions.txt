Setup Instructions

This project runs on a Mac computer with the Xcode Bundle 3.2.5 using the simulator 4.2.

	1	Open Xcode.
	2	click 'open other...'.
	3	Locate the project named soundplayer.xcodeproj and open it.
	4	When the project is loaded click the 'Build and Debug' to run the simulator.

	Please note that the directory called 'notes' and the caf audio 
	file named 'tock' should be linked with the project. If they don't please
	drag and drop them into the resources directory before running the 
	simulator.

	I have included with this project two examples of tabs which are .Plist files called 
	"smoke" and "ainttalkingbout". These are tabs of the songs "Smoke on the water" and 
	"Aint Talkin Bout Love". To used these files You have to locate the Iphone Applications 
	folder. Heres the path for my computer: 

	/Users/student/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/4.2/Applications

	Within this folder there are folders with names as serial numbers. The folder that was 
	most recently created will probably be this apps folder. Within the Apps directory will 
	be the 'Documents' directory which is where you can place the Plist tab files. When this 
	is done you can use the tabs in the Simulator. You should see the names of the tabs when 
	you click the 'open' button on the main interface.
